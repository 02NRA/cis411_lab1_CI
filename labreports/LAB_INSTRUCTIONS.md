# CIS 411 Lab 0: GitHub + CircleCI
The purpose of this lab is to both impart/confirm a level of professional comfort working with tools like GitHub and CircleCI as well as to invite a student to consider what precisely is happening conceptually and actually (behind the scenes) in the execution of the lab. 

## Submitting work
Lab reports will be submitted by generating a markdown file (if you don't know markdown, I recommend checking [1000 places on the Interwebs](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=learn+markdown)) in the labreports directory under the naming convention: __LAB_[GITHUB HANDLE].md__.
